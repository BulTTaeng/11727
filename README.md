## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

Similar to question that I solved.

The only different thing is that 2X2 tile is added.

Because of that reason, we can put two 1X2 tiles , one 2X2 tile after (i-2) situation. After (i-1) situation, we can put one 2X1 tile.

With this, it was easy to make equation.


## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
Thank you for visiting this github!
